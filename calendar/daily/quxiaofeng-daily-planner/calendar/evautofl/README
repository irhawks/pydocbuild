evautofl.sty
============

This package provides an environment within which pages are framed with cut
lines and printed with punch-marks, so that printed text can easily be
inserted into a filofax or binder.


Changes in v0.3 (2005/01/20)
o Corrected (really!) the unequal spacing of punchgroups.
o Corrected the odd framed pages' outer margin.

Changes in v0.2 (2005/01/14)
o Added a little stupid example of use.
o Corrected the effects of punchmargin on odd pages.
o Corrected the unequal spacing of punchgroups.

Changes in v0.1 (2003/03/21)
o First public release; there are certainly some bugs.
