# MaterialCV

![Material CV preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amng/MaterialCv/master/images/preview.PNG)

Description: This latex template design was based on the Google Material Design for the new Android 5.0 L version, using the font Roboto from Android.

In order to replace the main image with a profile picture for example, just replace the pic.png file in the images folder with another with the same resolution  or ratio (2048x600/1024x300/etc...).

The compilation should be made using XeTeX.
In order to make it easier to edit each of the sections, all the sections were separated into individual .tex files.

Aknowledgements:

The font used was the font Roboto used in Android: [Roboto Font](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html)

Used the elegant font iconset for icons (colors were changed acording to the color of the separator): [Elegant font](http://www.flaticon.com/packs/elegant-font)
