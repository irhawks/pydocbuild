Dear Mr. Smith,

 

I am writing to recommend Tom Thompson for the position of Sales Manager at ABC Company. I had the pleasure of working directly with Tom during his time as a salesperson at XYZ, Inc., and his tremendous abilities never ceased to amaze me. I was Tom’s direct supervisor at XYZ, and during that time, we worked together closely, so I fully understand his capabilities.

 

Tom’s incredible adaptability with potential clients has let him excel in sales. His uncanny ability to know what the client wants before they tell him makes customers feel comfortable with him. His flexibility also allows him to quickly switch tactics if the customer changes their mind about something at the last minute. While at XYZ, Tom managed to sell our product to several clients who had been on the fence about wanting to buy our products for years. Tom’s great connection with the customers and relentless perseverance to always make the customer happy allowed him to become the number one salesperson at our company for five years in a row. The sales numbers he reached far exceeded any previous winners.

 

Tom is also able to work effectively with other co-workers, making him a great addition to the team. After taking the initiative to sign up for classes on leadership and interpersonal skills, he even presented the information he learned to the rest of the company, which dramatically improved the way we communicate. I have enjoyed watching the way he has grown and excelled at XYZ, Inc.

 

With his abilities, adaptability, and dedication, Tom will make a great Sales Manager for ABC Company. I have no doubts you will be exceptionally pleased if you hire him. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the above address.  

 

Sincerely,

John Johnson
