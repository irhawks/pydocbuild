\opening{To Whom It May Concern:}

Northeastern created the nation's first college devoted to computer science in 1982, and today's College of Computer and Information Science remains a
national leader in education and research innovation

Here, education and research focus on providing the knowledge and perspective needed in an increasingly complex world. Educational programs combine computing with an important application domain, such as health or security. Research both advances computing and contributes to resolving major societal challenges.

The college's programs, faculty, and research are developing international prominence in four significant areas: cyber security, personal health informatics, network science, and software reliability.
