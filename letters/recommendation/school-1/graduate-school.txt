As the Dean of College of Humanities and Social Sciences of Montclair State University, I am writing to you in support of Ms. Sophie Lafrenier and her desire to attend Steinhardt NYU for the Joint Degree of Steinhardt and GSAS - Teaching French as a Foreign Language (7-12) and TESOL (FLTF/ESL-MA) program.

 

Ms. Lafrenier has been my student for more than three years and she has shown academic aptitude and ambition above and beyond among her peers. She was in several of my classes but most notably performed remarkably on Theories and Approaches to Teaching French as a Second Language and Advanced French Grammar. She has often made critical points on class discussions that demonstrated her exceptional ability to analyze advanced French literature texts. Even her written works are exemplary and often lauded by the class. Her paper for the 20th Century French Literature class showed her vast knowledge of modern representative works of contemporary theater and novel. She was given a scholarship for her top notch performance on the Teacher Education Program, and was part of a very limited immersion group trip to Marseille that I headed. She showed how well read she is, with a firm grip on history and on colloquial aspects of the site, even being mistaken for a local many times on the trip. She is even enrolled in a few more electives than her course requires, expressing her hunger to learn.

 

Her curiosity about her roots with her drive for education is what makes her such an exceptional student. Without reservation, I recommend her highly for your program. Please do not hesitate to contact me to provide you with any further information regarding Ms. Lafrenier.

 

 

 

Best regards,
